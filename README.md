##.:. GENERAL NOTES

Here's the repository with the definitions made during the Pro-To-Typo Processing workshop held by Alessio Erioli - Co-de-iT at RUFA [http://www.unirufa.it/]. There are also some extra to play with.
The workshop was focused on generative graphic and typography with Processing

###. day 01


.

***d01_00_library_test***

preliminary sketch to test correct installation of all libraries. If a grey window of about 100x100 pixels appear and nothing else happens, everything is ok


***d01_01_class_begin***

first sketch - several introductory stuff, the current version draws with mouse


***d01_02_class_aclass***

classes and objects - let's define a class and a few methods (behaviors)


***d01_03_jitterbug***

Jitterbug - simple class example with cascade constructors and save as png with transparent bg


***d01_xx_easing***

motion easing - mouse wheel controls threshold value


***d01_xx_geomerative_basics***

geomerative library basics - extract text as shape, extract points from shape

***d01_xx_inside_outside_text***

 slight modification of the example provided by AmnonP5 - [Generative Typography](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/generative-typography-processing-tutorial/)

uses the text drawn to an offscreen PGraphics to determine what color and shape it will draw to each xy-coordinate on the main screen

***d01_xx_Object_basics***

object and classes basics

***d01_xx_Object_behaviors***

object basics + behaviors

***d01_xx_particles_advanced***

particles with brightness field influence

***d01_xx_trig_bounce***

some trigonometry basics for animation

***d01_xx_trig_sincurve***

some trigonometry basics - sinusoid and Lissajous curve

***d01_xx_vector_basics***

basic vector operations

***day01_xx_trig_adv***

playing with (not so) basic trigonometry

###. day 02

***d02_01_class_bug***
the bug strikes back: class definition: fields, constructor, methods

***d02_02_class_bug_transp***
drawing and saving a png with transparent background

###. extra

***Prototypo_cover***

 cover design with Geomerative library
 
 Method
 
 generates ws cover
 . convert text to shapes
 . sample shapes for points
 . adds random points throughout the page
 . creates connections (3 orders of varying thickness according to distance range)

Notes

. pdf export in this sketch is done "old school" and not through a PGraphics
